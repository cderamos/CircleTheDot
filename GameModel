 * - the state of all the dots on the board (available, selected or 
 *  occupied by the blue dot
 * - the size of the board
 * - the number of steps since the last reset
 *
 * The model provides all of this informations to the other classes trough 
 *  appropriate Getters. 
 * The controller can also update the model through Setters.
 * Finally, the model is also in charge of initializing the game
